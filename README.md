## Synopsis

This is a small RPG game project made for fun by a programming enthusiast and college student, I am in no way experienced enough to be regarded as a professional, or even properly experiences, therefore this project shouldn't be taken super seiously.

This project is made as a tribute to some of my favorite games such as Cave Story and Undertale. 
The libray used in this project are: slick2d and LWJGL. More information about these libraries can be found here:

## Motivation

This project exists because I like to program games and I wanted to make something with minimalistic load on a computer system, that runs exceptionally well on most things. Also because I want to challenge myself and learn new things about java programming, developing with optimisation in mind and overall improve as a programmer.

## Installation

Download the *skyFiction.jar* file that in time will be located in the *dist* folder. At a later phase I might learn how to package jar files in *.exe* and *.app* executables, if I do they will also be located in the dist folder.
